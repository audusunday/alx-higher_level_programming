`This Project is a deep dive into Python Programming from scratch. The Python codes for files 0 and 1 are saved in the environment variable "$PYCODE" and the programs are meant to execute the following functions;

0 - Writes a Shell script that runs Python code.

1 - Writes a Shell script that runs Python code.

2 - Writes a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line, using the function print function.

3 - Completes a given source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

4 - Completes a given source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

5 - Completes a given source code in order to print 3 times a string stored in the variable str, followed by its first 9 characters.

6 - Completes a given source code in order to print "Welcome to Welcome to Holberton School!".

7 - Completes a given source code without the use of loops or conditional statements.

8 - Completes a given source code in order to printto print object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line`

9 - Writes a Python script that prints �~@\The Zen of Python�@~], by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

10 - Writes a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it using a given prototype.

11 - Writes a Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line.

12 - Writes a script that compiles a Python script file.

The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable $PYFILE
The output filename has to be $PYFILEc (ex: export PYFILE=my_main.py => output filename: my_main.pyc)

13 - Writes the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b): that does exactly the same as a given Python bytecode.
