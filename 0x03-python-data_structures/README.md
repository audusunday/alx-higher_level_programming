This project is a deep dive into Python - Data Structures: Lists and Tuples. The prototypes of all the functiona are stored in the list.h file and other files's program are executed thus;

0 - a function that prints all integers of a list.

1 - Writes a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C. If idx is negative, the function should return None. If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None.

2 - Writes a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C). If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list. If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list.

3 - Writes a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

4 - Writes a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C). If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list. If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return a copy of the original list.

5 - Writes a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.

6 - Writes a function that prints a matrix of integers.

7 - Writes a function that adds 2 tuples. Returns a tuple with 2 integers; The first element is an addition of the first element of each argument. The second element is an addition of the second element of each argument.

8 - Writes a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

9 - Writes a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.

10 - Writes a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list. Return a new list with True or False, depending on whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2.

11 - Writes a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list. If idx is negative or out of range, nothing change (returns the same list).

12 - Completes a given source code in order to switch value of a and b.

13 - Writes a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome. Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome.

14 - Create a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists. Starts by reading; listobject.h object.h Common Object Structures List Objects
